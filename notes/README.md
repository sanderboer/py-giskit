# Development Notes

This directory contains technical documentation and research notes that are important for understanding GISKit's implementation details but are not part of the user-facing documentation.

## Contents

- **BAG3D_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Critical notes on CityJSON transform handling and walking grid implications
- **QUIRKS_SYSTEM.md** - Documentation of API compatibility system
- **CRS_HANDLING.md** - Coordinate reference system transformations across protocols
- **EXPORT_SYSTEM.md** - IFC/GLB export implementation notes

These documents are kept for developers and maintainers who need to understand the internal workings of GISKit.
